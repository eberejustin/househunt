#### **Scenario B: Comment on Apartment** 
1. In Browser Window 1: Click on any apartment in the list
2. Scroll to comments section 
3. Type a comment and submit

### 4. Backend Activity Monitor

The console shows real-time WebSocket activity:
```
New WebSocket connection
User user123 connected via WebSocket. Total connections: 1
Created and sent 2 notifications for comment_created
Sent notification to 1 connections for user user456
```

### 5. Notification Types Implemented

| Action | Notification Title | Excluded User |
|--------|-------------------|---------------|
| Add Apartment | "New Apartment Added" | Creator |
| Add Comment | "New Comment Added" | Commenter |
| Toggle Favorite | Not implemented yet | N/A |

## Technical Implementation

- **WebSocket Authentication**: Users authenticate with their user ID upon connection
- **Real-Time Broadcasting**: Server sends notifications to all connected users except the actor
- **Persistent Storage**: All notifications saved to database for history
- **Auto-Refresh**: Frontend automatically refreshes relevant data when notifications arrive
- **Error Handling**: Connection failures are handled gracefully with reconnection logic

## Testing the System

1. **Open the app** in your browser
2. **Check the notification bell** in the top-right header
3. **Try adding apartments and comments** to see real-time updates
4. **Monitor the console** for WebSocket connection logs
5. **Test with multiple browser tabs** for full collaborative experience
